# FizzBuzz

## Welcome

Welcome to FizzBuzz Web, where even sharing calculations should be fun!

Remember the days when calculating was boring? Well, this just added a bit more fun!

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a game you are all very familiar with, but this one brings a twist to your average counting routine. Here's how it works:
- **Fizz**: If the number is divisible by 3, you say "Fizz" instead of the number.
- **Buzz**: If the number is divisible by 5, you say "Buzz" instead of the number.
- **FizzBuzz**: If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you say "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Sounds simple? It is, but itâ€™s also so much fun!

## Why Play?

Because why not? You really need some added fun in your day!

### Have fun!
